def _get_other_intervals(interval, start_times, end_times):
    """
    Return differences between start_times and end_times not equal to interval.

    Algorithm is that the difference is computed between each start_time and
    the corresponding end_time, and this difference is compared to interval.
    If the difference is equal to the interval, it's discarded, so the final
    result is any differences that are not equal to the interval.

    This means that an empty list is returned if, for all indices N:
    start_times[N] - end_times[N] == interval

    Interval, and each element of start_times and end_times are numpy arrays,
    using the same array format of a six element array, where first element is
    years, second is months, third is days, fourth is hour, fifth is minutes
    and the final element is seconds.

    Parameters
    ----------
    interval: :class:`np.ndarray`
        Interval to remove from returned result.
    start_times: :class:`np.ndarray`
        Sequence of arrays where each array contains a time stamp, i.e. LBYR,
        LBMON etc from F03.
    end_times: :class:`np.ndarray`
        Sequence of arrays where each array contains a time stamp, i.e. LBYRD,
        LBMOND etc from F03.

    Returns
    -------
    : list of :class:`np.ndarray`
        Differences between each start and end time that is not equal to interval.

    Examples
    --------

    Consistent difference of one month between start and end times:

    >>> interval = np.array([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0])
    >>> start_times = [np.array([0, i, 0, 0, 0, 0]) for i in range(4)]
    >>> end_times = [np.array([0, i, 0, 0, 0, 0]) for i in range(1, 5)]
    >>> _get_other_intervals(interval, start_times, end_times)
    []

    And now let's make the final end time have a difference of one month and
    one second from the final start time:

    >>> end_times[-1] = np.array([0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1])
    >>> _get_other_intervals(interval, start_times, end_times)

def _get_flh_interval_as_array(time_coord):
    """
    Return the interval for the time coordinate defined for this instance.

    An interval is returned when any of the following conditions are met:

    1. The time coordinate is bounded.
    2. The bounds are contiguous i.e. the upper bound for point N must be
       coincident with the lower bound for point N+1.
    3. The difference between the two bounds for each time is exactly 1
       year, exactly 1 month or a positive integer number of days.

    An exception is thrown when none of the above conditions are met.

    If the time coordinate should have an interval detectable by the above
    definition, but is not recognised as such by this function, a
    preprocessing stage may be required to change the time information to
    conform to the above criteria.

        insertion into the the raw fixed length header.  0th element of array

    Tests whether a time coordinate corresponds to a periodic ancillary.

    It is not easy to determine whether a time coordinate should be treated
    as periodic or not.  This implementation only looks for annual
    periodicity.  If you have times with different periodicity then this
    function will need adapting.

    A time coordinate is annual and periodic if the end bound
    of the last time is exactly one year after the start bound of the first
    time.  If this does not work for your time coordinate first ensure that
    your time coordinate is consistent with CF use of bounds.
    You may need to  pre-process the bounds values as necessary.

    If your time coordinate is annually periodic, is not recognised as
    periodic by this function and editing would change the meaning of the
    data then this function may need adapting.

    ----------
    times :  :class:`iris.coords.Coord`

        does not have the `nearest_neighbour_index` coordinate method.
