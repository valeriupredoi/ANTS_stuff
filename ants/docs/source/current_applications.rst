Applications are split between :ref:`core-applications` and
:ref:`contrib-applications`.  The former is owned by the ANTS team and function
as general purpose scripts applicable to many people/workflows.
The later concerns science owned applications which typically utilise ants to
generate ancillaries.
This page serves to document the list of applications available.  Each
application has a corresponding `[source]` link, which is useful for opening
the corresponding location (source code).

For further details on how to actually run these applications, see
:ref:`running-applications`.  All applications support the ``--help`` argument
to display detailed usage information.
