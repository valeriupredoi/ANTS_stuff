Appendix B: Contributor Licence Agreement (v1)
==============================================

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the ANTS Projects, which are managed by the Met Office.

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, all ANTS Projects must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. Each contributing individual within a contributing organisation must personally sign the CLA form.

This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of ANTS Projects and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

To sign the CLA please complete the form at the end of this page. Completion of this form constitutes a legally binding agreement between You and the Met Office.

The Met Office will collect, use and process your Personal Data for the purposes of supporting the development of the ANTS Projects and recording ownership of contributions. Your Personal Data will be processed in accordance with the Met Office Privacy Policy and UK and European Data Protection Laws (the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation EU 2016/680). The legal basis for processing is contractual necessity, as set out in the Privacy Policy. Personal Data processed by the Met Office will not be disclosed to third parties for marketing purposes. Your MOSRS username will be stored in order to permit Developers of ANTS Projects to ascertain that your contribution is covered by a signed CLA. Your Personal Data will be stored on a Sharepoint site belonging to the ANTS administrators. For further information, please see the `Privacy Policy <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/legal/privacy>`_.

To end this agreement please contact miao@metoffice.gov.uk. This will result in your MOSRS username being removed from the list of CLA signees and will prevent further contributions being accepted to ANTS projects. Please be aware that for purposes of recording previous agreements of Your existing Contributions, it is not possible to withdraw the signed CLA from the historical archive. This does not affect your rights as a data subject, as set out in the `Privacy Policy <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/legal/privacy>`_.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your past, present and future Contributions submitted to ANTS Projects. In return, the Met Office shall not use Your Contributions in a way that is contrary to the interests of users of the ANTS Projects. Except for the license granted herein to the Met Office and recipients of software distributed by ANTS Projects, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.
