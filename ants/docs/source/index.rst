 Ancillary Tools User Guide
=======================================

Welcome to the ancillary tools (ANTS) documentation.  ANTS aims to help you produce ancillary files.  ANTS will help you when you want to do any of the following:

  1. Produce ancillary files on a new model domain.
  2. Produce a new set of ancillaries from new source data.
  3. Derive a completely new set of ancillary fields for a new parametrisation scheme.

Ants is in early development, so your assistance in reporting `bugs <https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/ancil/newticket?component=ants&milestone=Ants%20Support&cc=miao@metoffice.gov.uk>`_ and `documentation <https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/ancil/newticket?component=ants&milestone=Ants%20Support&type=documentation&cc=miao@metoffice.gov.uk>`_ issues would be gratefully received.  We're particularly keen to identify where the documentation could be clearer - suggested improvements are not necessary but are appreciated.  If you'd prefer not to open a ticket, you can also :ref:`contact us directly <Contact>`.
