River routing application
*************************

Derive the river routing sequence and direction ancillaries.

The following steps are taken:

* Landcover fraction field (LCF) is regridded to the river routing field
  using an area weighted regrid.
* Regridded LCF is used to identify points which are entirely ocean and
  those coastal points which do not have any river flow going into them.
* At points that are entirely ocean and coastal points that have no river
  flow going into them, the river direction and sequence is set to missing
  data.
* At coastal points that do have flow going into them, the river direction
  is set to 9, to signify a pour point into the ocean.
* order_nemo_rivers: Sort rivers into an order, giving each river outflow
  a unique ID number. Puts these river numbers into UM and NEMO
  river_number ancillary files.
* On output of ancillary, the UM grid definition is inherited from the
  input LCF, as there is a detachment between the river routing field and
  the UM grid definition.

In the resulting river routing ancillary file the directions define where
the flow goes from point x:

 | 8  1  2
 | 7  x  3
 | 6  5  4

  9 = outflow to ocean
  10 = inland basin flow

e.g. 3 means the river flows eastwards

For GC5 (and later) ancillary files: "land_threshold_outflow=0.5" should be
provided to enable the outflow points to fall on the coast.
"make_nemo_rivers" should be set to True to enable the generation of UM and
NEMO river_number ancillary files.

For GC4 (and earlier) ancillary files: "land_threshold_outflow=0.0" and
"make_nemo_rivers=False" should replicate old river coupling behviour.
